# Northwind-Traders-SQL-Analysis
This project applies a wide range of SQL concepts to manipulate and analyze the Northwind database, a comprehensive dataset provided by Microsoft. The goal is to explore the trends and patterns of sales performance, product performance, and employee efficiency.


## Project Details
- **Database Manipulation and Analysis**: The Northwind database contains data on various aspects such as sales, products, and employees. The project focuses on two main areas: Sales Performance Analysis and Employee Efficiency Analysis. It uncovers insights into the operations of Northwind Traders, providing valuable information for business decisions.

- **SQL Techniques**: Various SQL techniques such as joins, aggregate functions, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are used to display key metrics and insights. These include total sales of each product by category, sales by employees, total freight cost by each company, sales by region, and more.

- **Complex Requirements**: The project adds complexity and depth to the analysis by tackling a total of 85 requirements, each designed to test and improve the understanding of different SQL concepts. These requirements range from displaying specific data from tables, performing condition-based queries, working with different types of joins, to implementing aggregate and window functions.

- **Time Series Analysis**: The project conducts a week-over-week analysis of order counts and calculates the percentage change over the previous week. This provides a dynamic view of the company's performance over time.

- **Performance Analysis**: The project identifies top-performing products and categories, as well as countries contributing to significant portions of total sales. Also analyzed employee performance in terms of sales and freight costs.

- **Customer Analysis**: The project identifies repeat customers, customers contributing to a significant portion of sales, and customers placing orders less frequently than average. This helped understand customer behavior and can inform customer relationship management strategies.

This project demonstrates the power of SQL as a tool for data manipulation and analysis, providing valuable insights into the operations of Northwind Traders.
